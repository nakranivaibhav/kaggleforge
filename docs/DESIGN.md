# kaggleforge — design & rationale

This is the *why* behind the playbook. The standing contract is `CLAUDE.md`; the
procedures are the skills in `.claude/skills/`; the workers are the subagents in
`.claude/agents/`; the proposer↔critic refinement loop is
`.claude/workflows/propose-loop.js`; the reusable code is in `tools/`. This file explains the research lineage we
borrowed from, why we run it as markdown inside Claude Code, the graph/gate/
validation/resume models, the mapping from our sibling neural-ring-detector loop,
and the honest expectations.

## 1 · Research lineage — what we took, and from where

Five papers shaped this system. We took one proven lever from each and left the
rest.

**AutoKaggle (arXiv:2410.20424)** — a multi-agent *phase pipeline*
(understand → EDA → engineering → model → submit) with a reader/planner/
developer/reviewer cast. Its two empirically-load-bearing parts are (a) a
**validated tools library** the agents call instead of re-deriving boilerplate,
and (b) **per-phase unit tests**: the paper reports its *completion* rate rising
from **0.10 → 0.85** once each phase had to pass its own tests before the next
began. We took both. Our `tools/` (make_folds, leakage_scan, validate_submission,
kaggle_io) *is* the validated library; "every node — including data-cleaning and
feature nodes — clears the unit-test + leakage suite before its CV counts"
(CLAUDE.md) is the per-phase-test discipline applied at node granularity. We did
**not** keep the rigid linear phase chain — see AIDE.

**AIDE (arXiv:2502.13138)** — a *single-agent best-first **solution-tree
search***. Each node is a complete solution; three operators grow the tree —
**draft** (a fresh approach), **improve** (one change on a working node), **debug**
(repair a broken one) — and the search greedily expands the best valid node.
The decisive idea: **history lives in the tree, not the context window**. The
agent never has to re-summarise its past; the tree *is* the memory, and a node's
parent edge records exactly what was tried. On MLE-bench, AIDE earned **~4× more
medals than the best linear (phase-pipeline) agent**. We took the **operators +
tree-as-memory** (§3), generalised from AIDE's tree to a **DAG** so a `combine` node
can merge several parents. We did **not** keep AIDE's *greedy best-first
expansion*: instead a `kaggle-proposer` agent proposes a small batch each round and
the orchestrator builds **every** confirmed proposal — simpler to supervise, and the
proposer (not a search controller) carries the policy for what to try next.

**MLE-bench (arXiv:2410.07095)** — the **medal yardstick**: 75 real Kaggle
competitions, scored against the actual private leaderboards, reporting
any-medal pass rates. Numbers worth internalising for expectation-setting:
o1-preview + AIDE scored **~16.9% any-medal pass@1, rising to ~34.1% pass@8**;
**Claude 3.5 Sonnet + AIDE ~7.6%**. The cost is real — a full sweep is roughly
**~1800 GPU-hours ≈ $3k per seed**. The honest reading: *autonomy medals on a
minority of competitions.* This is precisely why kaggleforge is **human-in-the-loop**
— we spend the human's judgement at the few irreversible gates (metric reading,
real submissions) where being wrong is catastrophic, and let the machine grind
the reversible middle. We treat the official metric on a trustworthy local CV as
the target and the public LB as the out-of-distribution check (CLAUDE.md Mission).

**Agent K (arXiv:2411.03562)** — an **RL-free** agent with a **nested,
cross-competition memory** that accumulates structured experience and reaches
**Kaggle-grandmaster-equivalent** performance without policy-gradient training.
Lesson taken: durable memory > clever weights. Within a comp, our memory is the
append-only `journal.md` + `submissions.md` ledger + the `graph.md` node records; across
comps it is the shared, in-place-extended `tools/` library and these docs. We do
*not* yet carry a cross-comp case bank — that is the natural next increment, and
it would slot into the toolkit gate.

**DS-Agent (arXiv:2402.17453)** — **case-based reasoning**: *retrieve a relevant
past solution before proposing*. We honour the spirit at the toolkit/experiment-
plan gates: the first drafts seed from known-good recipes for the task type
(GBDT-on-tabular, Darts-for-time-series) rather than inventing from scratch, and
the library/family choice at the toolkit gate seeds the root branches. A full
retrieval bank is future work; for now the "cases" are the recipes encoded in the
skills and the operator's parents rule.

**One-line summary of the borrow:** *AutoKaggle's tests + tools, run over AIDE's
search (generalised to a DAG), measured by MLE-bench's medal yardstick, with Agent-K-style durable memory
and a DS-Agent retrieve-before-propose instinct — all wrapped in a human-gated
shell.*

## 2 · Why markdown-driven, inside Claude Code

The whole system is files a fresh Claude session can read and act on — no bespoke
runtime. Four Claude Code primitives map cleanly onto four roles:

| primitive | role here | example |
|---|---|---|
| **skill** (`.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`) | a **procedure** the main session runs at a gate | `/kaggle-validate` freezes the CV |
| **subagent** (`.claude/agents/*.md`) | an **isolated worker** with fresh context | `kaggle-developer` builds one node |
| **CLAUDE.md** | the **standing rules** every actor obeys | leakage voids a score; one atomic change/node |
| **workflow** (`.claude/workflows/propose-loop.js`) | a **deterministic agent loop** | `propose-loop` refines N proposals (proposer↔critic) |

**The key constraint that shapes everything: neither subagents nor the workflow
can pause for a human — only the main session can** (CLAUDE.md, "Operating mode").
A subagent runs to completion and returns; the workflow loops without a console.
So the architecture is **"gate the ends, auto the middle"**:

- Every **gate** (`understand · toolkit · eda · validation · experiment_plan ·
  submit`) lives in a **skill in the main session**, because only there can we
  render a Decision Card and *wait*.
- The **experiment grind** — propose → register → build every proposal → gate →
  decide — has no inherent need for a human mid-step, so it is delegated to
  subagents (and the `propose-loop` refinement workflow), sequenced by the main
  session as orchestrator.

That is why `understand` and `submit` stay human except in `full_auto`: a wrong
reading of the metric poisons every downstream CV, and a real submission is the
one irreversible, rate-limited, public action. The orchestrator reflects this — in
`auto_except_submit` it asks the human before spending a slot; in `full_auto` it
submits within budget.

---

## 3 · The graph model

The experiment graph (`graph.md`) is the search and the memory at once (the AIDE
idea, arXiv:2502.13138, generalised from a tree to a **DAG**). **Every node is one
atomic change** so every CV delta is attributable, and it **attaches to the
deepest ancestor(s) whose work it keeps** — most nodes have one parent, but a
`combine` node merges several:

| change | operator | parents |
|---|---|---|
| whole new approach / model family / framing | **draft** | `root` |
| build on a working solution (add feature, swap a part, tune) | **improve** | the 1 node it builds on |
| fix a broken node | **debug** | the 1 buggy node |
| blend / ensemble / stack several nodes | **combine** | the 2+ nodes it merges |

- The **toolkit gate seeds the root drafts**: "use Darts" and "LightGBM on lag
  features" are two drafts off `root` — two families, not two experiments inside
  one branch (this is where DS-Agent's retrieve-before-propose lands).
- The **champion is the best *valid* node anywhere in the graph** — best CV under
  the official direction, leakage-clean. On promotion, byte-copy its `src/` +
  `submission.csv` into `champion/` (cp, never symlink); a rejected node leaves
  `champion/` untouched.
- **Keep ≥2 families alive.** If the best lineage hasn't beaten CV by more than
  one parent-SEM over **5 consecutive improves**, force a **draft** of a
  structurally different family — *pivot the architecture, don't keep tuning*.
  This is the anti-local-minimum rule; tuning that stalls is the signal to draft.
- Status, not checkboxes. Each node's `node.md` carries a `status` field (`proposed ·
  running · buggy · valid · champion · dead`) and a `stage` field (the lifecycle);
  `graph.md` is the Mermaid DAG + table that maps them. **The statuses are the
  search frontier**, so a restart rebuilds the frontier by reading `graph.md`.

**Search policy (operator selection each round):** draft while valid-root-families
< `num_drafts` (default 4) → else debug the shallowest buggy node within depth
(≤5 attempts; regenerate from scratch after 3 fails; prune to `dead` after 5) →
else improve the best valid node with exactly one atomic change, A/B'd against its
parent and rejected on CV regress → else combine 2+ valid, de-correlated nodes when
a blend's OOF beats the best single. The **`kaggle-proposer`** agent applies this
policy to draft N independent proposals each round; the **`kaggle-proposal-reviewer`**
critiques them (the `propose-loop` workflow runs that refinement); then the
orchestrator builds **every** confirmed proposal — there is no best-first
frontier-expansion controller that picks which to expand.

**Data lineage (`data.md`).** `graph.md` is *experiment* lineage (node → parent);
`data.md` is its *data* companion — the engineered feature-sets (`raw → base → fs_*`)
and which nodes consume each, with every node linking back via its `uses_data` field.
The load-bearing part is the per-set **leak-safety class**: `stateless` (row-wise, no
fit — reusable as-is) vs `fit_in_fold` (a fitted transform or a **cross-row** stat —
target-encode, scaler, kNN density, group aggregate — built inside the train fold
only). This is not just bookkeeping: a *label-free* cross-row feature fit on the
whole train slips past the shuffled-label control yet still leaks, so the class is
what catches it. The proposer reuses a feature-set before re-engineering one and the
developer obeys the class; the leakage suite still enforces the result.

## 4 · Human-in-the-loop gates, the autonomy dial, Decision Cards

Each stage ends with a **Decision Card** — a plain-language readout (what's going
on / found or propose / why / cost in time·compute·submissions-out-of-5 / your
call), written for a smart non-specialist. We never show in-chat thumbnails as
proof; we report numbers + file paths and let the human open files at full
resolution (a lesson carried straight from the neural-ring-detector memory —
in-chat thumbnails hide 10-px offsets).

The **autonomy dial** (stored in `config.md`, flipped any time by voice) decides
which gates actually pause:

| mode | pauses at |
|---|---|
| `interactive` (default) | **every** gate — new comp, learning the data |
| `auto_except_submit` | only `understand` + `submit` — the experiment grind |
| `full_auto` | nothing — walk away |

`understand` and `submit` are the two gates kept human except in `full_auto`,
for the reasons in §2 (metric-poisoning, irreversibility). The dial is the single
control surface; the rest of the system reads it and behaves accordingly.

---

## 5 · Validation & leakage discipline

A leaky CV is worse than no CV — it *confidently* misleads. So validation is
frozen once and policed hard.

- **Freeze the CV once** (`/kaggle-validate` → `tools/make_folds.py`) and never
  refit across folds. `make_folds.py` picks the leak-correct scheme from the spec:
  `TimeSeriesSplit` if a time column, else `GroupKFold` if a group key, else
  `StratifiedKFold` for classification, else `KFold`. **The seed controls only the
  split.** Output is `folds.json` (positional integer indices). Carve an inviolable
  holdout never touched in training or feature-fit.
- **Fit inside the fold.** Every transform (scaler/encoder/imputer/target-encoder/
  selector) is fit on the train fold only — `make_folds.py` writes indices, the
  node's harness loops them, and `leakage_scan.py`'s static scan flags a global
  `.fit(` on full/concatenated train+test (`uv run tools/leakage_scan.py …`).
- **The surviving suite** (each a check in `tools/leakage_scan.py`, void-on-fail
  for `error` severity): fit-inside-fold, target leakage (no feature with
  near-perfect correlation to the target; target absent from features),
  id/order leakage, group leakage, temporal leakage (past-only lags/rolling, no
  centered windows, no global stats), duplicate detection (train↔test), and the
  CV-too-good tripwire.
- **Leakage gating is the static `tools/leakage_scan.py` scan only** (its exit code
  is the gate). The per-node shuffled-label control was removed — it permuted labels
  and refit the model, doubling compute on slow NN/foundation nodes for a check the
  static scan covers. The `kaggle-developer` runs the scan as part of its self-gate;
  `fit_in_fold` cases the scan can't see (a cross-row stat fit on full train) are
  caught by building the reference from train-fold rows only.
- **CV↔LB is a diagnostic, not a trigger.** A gap is *logged and surfaced*, never
  auto-acted; chasing the public LB causes private shake-up. **Trust a well-built
  CV over the public LB** (CLAUDE.md Hard rule 6). A submission slot only goes to
  a node that beats the last submitted CV by more than fold-noise — never to A/B
  on the LB.
- **Adversarial validation was dropped as a standing gate** — it is available
  only as a one-off diagnostic when a big unexplained CV↔LB gap appears, not run
  every node. The CV-too-good tripwire covers the routine "implausible jump" case
  and flags it for human eyes before a slot is spent.

This is AutoKaggle's per-phase-test lever (arXiv:2410.20424) applied at node
granularity: a feature that "improves CV" but fails fit-inside-fold is **buggy,
not good**, and its CV does not count.

---

## 6 · The resume model

A competition spans days and gets resumed, so state must survive a cold start
with zero in-context memory. Two rules make that safe.

- **Two resume surfaces**, both grounded in artifacts (never trust a label over
  the file it names):
  - **`progress.md`** (macro) — the one-time setup checklist + stage checkboxes +
    a derived header. Re-entry resumes at the first unticked stage.
  - **`node.md`** (micro) — the one converged node record (frontmatter = plan +
    metrics + gate booleans, body = plan prose; one file replacing the old
    node-record / metrics / gate-report trio, **no checkboxes**). Its **`stage`**
    field is the per-node lifecycle: `proposed → built → scored → reviewed →
    decided → submitted`. A `running` node resumes from its `stage` (e.g. `built`
    with no `cv` ⇒ resume at *score*).
- **Artifact-then-mark** (CLAUDE.md Hard rule 5): do the work → write the artifact
  (src/solution.py, train.log, leakage_scan.json, the `cv`/`gates` fields,
  submission.csv) → *then* advance `stage`. A stage with no backing artifact can
  never mislead — you verify against the artifact, and a stage claimed without one
  is a lie to be redone. A `running` node with no artifacts is marked `dead`.
- **Everywhere else is status or append-only:** the `graph.md` map + node `status`
  fields *are* the frontier; `journal.md` and `submissions.md` are append-only logs.
- **Dates from `date -u` UTC, never memory** (`date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%MZ`); your
  sense of "today" is stale on resume.
- **Budget & deadline are derived, never stored as a mutable counter.**
  `submissions.md` is the append-only UTC-timestamped ledger; "used today" is
  *computed* at read time (`grep -c "^| $(date -u +%F)" …submissions.md`, or
  `uv run tools/kaggle_io.py budget --ledger comps/<slug>/submissions.md`), so it
  can't drift across a resume. `progress.md`'s header is regenerated on read;
  `days_left = deadline − today`; when it shrinks, it's surfaced but the loop keeps
  experimenting — `/kaggle-final` is user-triggered only, never auto-started.

The canonical restart path is `/kaggle-status`: read `progress.md` → find the
in-progress stage → if experiments, read the `graph.md` map to rebuild the
frontier → open any `running` node's `node.md` and resume from its `stage`.

## 7 · Mapping from the sibling neural-ring-detector loop

kaggleforge is the same autonomous-loop shape as the sibling neural-ring-detector
"AutoResearch" agent, retargeted from "best ring model" to "best Kaggle solution."
The concepts map one-to-one — which is why the operating discipline feels familiar:

| neural-ring-detector | kaggleforge analogue |
|---|---|
| champion / challenger (best model so far vs the run) | **champion node** = best valid node in the graph; each new node is the challenger, A/B'd against its parent |
| per-experiment file isolation (`experiments/exp_NNN/src/`, self-contained) | per-node isolation (`comps/<slug>/nodes/node_NNNN/src/`, copy-parent-then-one-change); reusable code in `tools/` is extended in place, never forked |
| marker-file auto-polling (`[ -f $DONE ]`, never `pgrep -f` which self-matches) | identical marker-file pattern for long local trainings (`DONE=/tmp/<slug>_node_NNNN.done`; wait on `[ -f "$DONE" ]`), event-driven, no timers |
| `journal.md` (append-only, one dense line per experiment) | `journal.md` (append-only, one UTC line per node) + `submissions.md` ledger |
| `history.json` (champion record + experiments list) | the `graph.md` map + per-node `node.md` records + `champion/` byte-copy (the durable, resumable record) |
| visual_score ≥ 9.0 LLM-judge gate (Claude Vision rates eval cards) | **official-metric CV gate** + the human Decision-Card gate; the LLM-judge role is replaced by a *numeric* gate (the metric) plus *human* sign-off at submit, because Kaggle gives a real metric where ring-fit only had perceptual quality |
| "numeric metric is a proxy; visual quality is primary" | "well-built local CV is the target; public LB is the OOD check" — CV is the trustworthy signal, LB is the proxy that can mislead |
| `exp_NNN` ids, `experiments/` tree | `node_NNNN` ids, `graph.md` DAG with draft/improve/debug/combine operators |
| "silence is a bug — add prints and re-run" | same: a node that returns nothing/hangs gets log visibility, not a guess; `train.log` is tailed filtered for `cv=|Traceback|Error|Killed|OOM` |

The one substantive difference: ring-detection had **no ground-truth metric**, so
its gate was an LLM vision judge scoring perceptual ring-fit. Kaggle *does* have a
ground-truth metric, so the automatable gate is the numeric CV and the human is
reserved for the two judgement calls a number can't make — reading the metric
right (`understand`) and spending an irreversible public slot (`submit`).

## 8 · Known risks & honest expectations

- **Autonomy medals on a minority.** Per MLE-bench (arXiv:2410.07095), strong
  agent+scaffold combos clear any-medal on roughly **8–34%** of comps
  (Claude 3.5 Sonnet + AIDE ~7.6%; o1-preview + AIDE ~16.9% pass@1 → ~34.1%
  pass@8). Expect *competent, often-unplaced* runs, not routine gold. Set this
  expectation in the first Decision Card.
- **Compute & money are real.** A full bench sweep is ~1800 GPU-h ≈ $3k/seed
  (arXiv:2410.07095); a single comp is far less, but a stalled tree can burn time
  for nothing. The ≥2-families / pivot-after-5-stalled-improves rule is the
  circuit-breaker; the deadline-derived header is the hard stop.
- **The CV can still lie.** The leakage suite catches the common modes, but a
  novel leak (a sneaky group key, a time-ordered id) can slip the static scan.
  The shuffled-label control is the backstop; when CV looks too good, the tripwire
  forces human eyes before a slot is spent.
- **Public-LB temptation.** The single most common self-inflicted loss is chasing
  the public LB into a private shake-up. The discipline (trust CV, log-don't-act
  on the gap, slot only for a CV win) is a guardrail, not a guarantee — a human in
  `interactive` mode is the real safety net.
- **Two non-automatable Kaggle gates** (accept rules in the browser, phone-verify
  for GPU/internet) block downloads/submits and *cannot be retried around* — a
  403 means "rules not accepted / unverified," **not** bad creds (the #1
  misdiagnosis; `tools/kaggle_io.py classify-error` maps it). Surface them; don't
  loop.
- **No cross-comp case bank yet.** Agent K's nested memory (arXiv:2411.03562) and
  DS-Agent's retrieval (arXiv:2402.17453) are only partially realised — the
  "cases" are the recipes baked into skills and the in-place `tools/` library, not
  a queryable bank. That is the clearest next increment.
- **Single-agent search, supervised.** We deliberately run AIDE's search
  (arXiv:2502.13138, generalised to a DAG) as one human-gated search rather than an unbounded swarm.
  This trades raw throughput for attributable deltas and a human able to veto at
  the two gates that matter — the right trade when a wrong submission is public
  and rate-limited.
